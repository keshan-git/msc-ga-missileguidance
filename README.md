A guidance system is a virtual or physical device, or a group of devices implementing a guidance process used for controlling the movement of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or any other moving object.

Guidance is the process of calculating the changes in position, velocity, attitude, and/or rotation rates of a moving object required to follow a certain trajectory and/or attitude profile based on information about the object's state of motion.

Our intention is to make use of GA to make the most appropriate decision at the most appropriate time in order to optimize the result of the guidance system. To model the real-word scenario and the guidance system, CPHD munitions can be used.

The Copperhead (CPHD) is a 155 mm caliber cannon-launched, terminally laser guided, explosive projectile intended to engage hard point targets such as tanks, self-propelled howitzers or other high-value targets.
